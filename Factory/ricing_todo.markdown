# Todo

-   grml's zsh
-   sxiv
-   move tag of current client to another screen
-   playerctl
-   ysgrifennwr theme
-   mons https://github.com/Ventto/mons/blob/master/mons.sh
-   z
-   viewing already visible tags on other screens does not automatically focus them
-   prevent apps from creating 2nd tags, e.g. 🍓
-   h,j,k,l don't work in max mode => solutions: either let Tab cycle all windows or change h,j,k,l functionality dynamically
-   shortkeys for nnn, VS Code and Vivaldi in the awesome hotkeys menu
